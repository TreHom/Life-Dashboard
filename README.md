# Life-Dashboard

A simple python project of creating a life dashboard. The idea is to create something like a dashboard in a strategy game with all the resources on the upper tap and add in elements of
skill trees, probably using something like the tech tree format. 
To top it of add functions that can automatically update things like state of money and so on.
